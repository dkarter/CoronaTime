Changes in v1.1.0:
------------------
- Fixed title always showing Illinois, even though the user configured a different state as their default
- You can now search for statistics for a province or state other than the one you configured e.g. `;co Ontario` or `;co New South Wales`. I don't know all countries that the API supports, but I was able to confirm US, Canada, Australia and China
